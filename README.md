# How to run the ping-pong test on a local machine. 

### Disclaimer : I will be using Intellij to base my tutorial on.

First unpack the .zip folder containing the project folder.

After that import it using Intellij. 

Intellij will detect the Maven build script and you can press the load button.

This will setup the project for you. 

Once that is done you can run the PingPongApplication located in src/main/java/com/example/ping/pong/kamil/cwigun/pingpong/

Once you run the application you can go into your browser and enter the url localhost:8080/ping and shound see the "Pong" message/
